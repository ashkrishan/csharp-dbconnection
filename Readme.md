This console app demonstrates how to create interfaces with dependency injection. It is ony structure and doesn;t have any meaningful method implementation.

This app must only be used to look at the structure in terms of :
Encapsulation - Abstract classes, properties with access modifiers.
Polymorphism - Interfaces e.g: IDBConnection 
Extensibility - Dependency injection e.g: SQL
