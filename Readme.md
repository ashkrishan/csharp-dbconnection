This console app demonstrates how to create interfaces with dependency injection. It is ony structure and doesn;t have any meaningful method implementation.

This app must only be used to look at the structure in terms of

1. Encapsulation - Abstract classes, properties with access modifiers.     
2. Polymorphism - Interfaces e.g: IDBConnection.        
3. Extensibility - Dependency injection e.g: SQLCommand
